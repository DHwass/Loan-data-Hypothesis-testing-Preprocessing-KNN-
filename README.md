# Objective

The main goal of this project is to tackle several important tasks. First, we want to answer questions about the data by conducting **hypothesis testing**. This will help us gain meaningful insights and draw conclusions from the information we have.

Next, we aim to identify any flaws or issues in the data. By carefully examining the dataset, we'll be able to find and address any inconsistencies or errors, ensuring that our analysis is based on reliable and accurate data.

Once the data is cleaned and validated, we'll dive into data analysis. This involves exploring the dataset, looking for patterns, trends, and relationships that can provide valuable insights. By understanding the data better, we can make informed decisions and uncover important findings.

Finally, our objective is to build the best possible prediction model using **KNN Classifier**.
