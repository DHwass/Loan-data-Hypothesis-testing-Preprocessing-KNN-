## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze loan data, addressing key questions through hypothesis testing, data visualization, and ultimately building a predictive model using the KNN Classifier.

## Dataset Overview
Briefly introduce the dataset, highlighting key features and its relevance to the loan analysis and prediction objectives.

## Hypothesis Testing and Visualizations
Explore the dataset through hypothesis testing and visualizations. Answer crucial questions about the data, such as demographic-based variations in loan status and other relevant insights.

## Data Cleaning
Detail the steps taken to clean the dataset, ensuring data reliability for subsequent analysis. Address any anomalies or inconsistencies to enhance the quality of the data.

## KNN Classifier
Describe the implementation of the KNN Classifier for predictive modeling. Explain how the model is built and its significance in predicting loan-related outcomes.
